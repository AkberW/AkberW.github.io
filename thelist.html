						The boy was walking down the street, going home from the bus stop, when two kids he recognized from Jefferson High approached him. They threatened to hurt
						him if he did not give them his money. So, the boy, Mike, gave all he had in a swift motion, as if it were routine. When Mike made it home, he went
						straight up to his room and went to sleep.
					</p>
					<p>
						The next morning, Mike woke up, got ready, and went down to the kitchen to have breakfast with his family. His mom was over at the counter quickly making
						coffee and his father was sitting at the table eating while reading the newspaper. "Good morning, Mom. Good morning, Dad," Mike said cheerfully. There was
						no answer, just the sound of the coffee machine. Mike then went and poured himself a bowl of cereal and sat down next to his dad at the table. He did not
						speak to his father; he did not want to bother him. As Mike's mom finished making her coffee, she got her things together and was out the door. His dad was
						also leaving, but before he left, Mike said to him, "Dad, I need some money for lunch." "Didn't I give you twenty dollars yesterday?" his dad replied. Mike
						then said, "Yeah, but when I was walking home yesterday, these two guys from school told me I had to give them all the money I had or they would beat me
						up." Mike's father had an annoyed look on his face and said, "Again? I told you to stop losing money like that Mike, take another way home or something."
						He then took twenty dollars out of his wallet, gave it to Mike, and left without saying or hearing another word.
					</p>
					<p>
						Mike finished eating his cereal and started walking to the bus stop. When he arrived he saw the usual crowd, talking and laughing, enjoying life. Mike
						would listen to his iPod while waiting at the bus stop. When the bus would arrive at the school, Mike would go straight to class. When lunchtime came
						around, Mike would sit alone at a table in the corner of the cafeteria. Today, however, was different. Someone would join him.
					</p>
					<p>
						"Can I sit here?" asked a girl whom Mike had never seen before. She stood there with her food tray in one hand as she playfully curled her long hair with
						the other waiting for a reply. "Yeah, sure," Mike said with half of his attention to the girl and half to his music. "Thanks," she said as she sat down,
						"I'm new here and all the other tables are kinda crowded. I'm Jamie by the way" Mike, removing his headphones completely, shyly said, "Nice to meet you, my
						name is Mike." "Sooo, Mike, how is this school? Is it fun?" Jamie said who seemed very interested in what Mike was going to say. "Umm, it's alright I
						guess. The teachers are nice, they make jokes sometimes and they're good at teaching and a lot of them are ni--, oh I already said that," Mike said with a
						nervous chuckle. "Ha-ha, I bet they are. How about the parties? Are there any crazy parties that happen on weekends and stuff? Is there one this weekend?"
						Jamie asked. Mike paused for a moment, thinking of what to say, as he had not been to a party, ever. "I'm not really the party type, but I do hear people
						talking about parties that happen over the weekend. So, you just have to ask around," Mike said with more confidence than when he last spoke. The bell then
						rang and Mike and Jamie got up from the table. "Thanks. I'll be sure to ask people, see ya around," Jamie said as she walked away to her next class.
					</p>
					<p>
						Mike could not believe the experience he just had. He was walking to his class differently; he had confidence in his walk and was smiling. He was almost at
						his class when Ben, the most popular kid in school, approached him. "Hey kid, what's your name?" Ben said. Mike was confused because Ben had never spoken
						to him before. With a puzzled look on his face Mike said, "Who, me?" Ben sarcastically replied, "Noooo, I'm talking to the wall, of course you" "Umm, my
						name is Mike." "Well, Mike," Ben started. "Do you know who I am? Never mind, don't answer that, of course you do, who doesn't know me? Anyways, who was
						that girl you were talking to at lunch, I've never seen her before and trust me, if I had I wouldn't forget her, she's hot." Mike's confidence had
						disappeared as well as the smile he had on his face. He replied to Ben saying, "Her names Jamie, she said she's a new student here." Ben with a grin on his
						face said, "Oh okay, okay. I like that. Well, listen thanks for the help, ima have to get with that, if ya know what I mean." Ben walked away. Mike, who
						was still confused with what had just happened went into his class, took out his notebook, and wrote Ben's name in his notebook.
					</p>
					<p>
						When Mike moved on to his last class of the day, he was surprised when he saw Jamie walk in. Jamie saw Mike and went and sat down in the seat next to him.
						"Hey Mike! This is so cool, we're in the same class," she said. "Yeah, it should be fun," Mike replied. The teacher walked in and both of them stopped
						talking. After class, Mike left the classroom and started walking towards his locker when Jamie called out to him. "Mike! Mike! Wait up, I have to ask you
						something." Mike turned around and waited for Jamie to catch up to him. "Hey, sorry, I just wanted to ask you if you could help me catch up in class 'cause
						I'm a little behind," she said. "Yeah, sure, do you want my notes or I guess I could help you at lunch," Mike said quickly. "Oh, sorry are you in a rush?
						Here just take my number and we can talk about it later." Mike agreed and gave her his number and got her number and entered it into his phone. Mike then
						quickly left without saying bye, which Jamie thought was strange.
					</p>
					<p>
						The next day, Mike walked in school and saw people crying and hugging each other. Jamie saw him come in and walked in his direction. "Hey Jamie, sorry I
						didn't get a chance to text you last night, I got caught up with something," Mike said. "What? Oh, forget about that, didn't you hear what happened?" Jamie
						replied. Mike had a clueless look on his face implying that he had not heard what had happened. "Two kids from this school were killed last night, it's
						crazy, nobody knows how it happened or who did it," she said. "WHAT? That's crazy. They were killed? Man, I wonder why they were killed," he replied.
						"Nobody knows, but the police are already investigating to find out the killer. I just moved here, I thought this was a safe place to live." "It is, I
						don't know how this happened. Don't worry though, I won't let anything happen to you," Mike said with a smile on his face. Jamie giggled and thanked Mike.
					</p>
					<p>
						When lunchtime came around, Mike was at his usual table. He was alone until Jamie came and sat down. They started talking about the class and what Jamie
						had missed so far. After a few minutes, Ben walked to the table and said, "Hey Mike, what's up?" Mike with a confused look on his face again said, "Not
						much, just eating and studying." "Ha-ha, yeah that's totally you, Mike. One day you're gonna be making millions," Ben replied. He then turned his focus to
						Jamie and said, "Hey, you're Jamie, right?" "Yeah Jamie, How'd you know that?" "Well, I found out from my main man Mike right here," He said with a grin.
						"Oh, you and Mike are friends?" Jamie said with a surprised look on her face. "Of course, me and Mike go way back. So I know he won't mind if I steal you
						away for a second." Ben looked at Mike with a strong look implying that he should agree with him unless he wanted to face the consequences. "Yeah, sure, go
						ahead," Mike said in a low voice. "I don't know, I don't think I should leave Mike alone," Jamie said. "Aw come on. I promise it'll only be like ten
						minutes, Mike'll be okay," Ben replied. After some convincing, Jamie agreed and left with Ben. Mike watched Ben take her to his table with all the cool
						kids. Lunch ended and Jamie had stayed at the table with Ben the whole time.
					</p>
					<p>
						Mike went on to his next class with his head down and no smile on his face. When he got to his last class, the class Jamie was in, they both sat next to
						each other again. Jamie said to him, "I'm so sorry, Mike. I got really caught up with Ben and his friends I just lost track of time. He's so nice; I can
						tell why he's so popular." "Oh, yea no it's okay. It's good that you're meeting more people," he replied. When class was just about over, the PA system
						went off. It was the principle of the school sending a message out to the whole school. He said, "Attention students and faculty, as you may have heard,
						two of our students were tragically taken away from us yesterday. The police are investigating the case as we speak, but still do not have any suspects.
						This message is to remind you to get home safely, even if the crime had nothing to do with the school, we have to all realize what has occurred and take
						all of the necessary precautions. Thank you and have a safe weekend." "I still can't believe that happened," Jamie said to Mike. "Yeah, it's so crazy. Make
						sure you go straight home, I'm sure nothing will happen to you though," he replied. Mike and Jamie parted ways and went home on their respective buses.
					</p>
					<p>
						When Mike arrived at his house, he went inside and saw his parents packing their suitcases. He asked his father why they were doing so and he told Mike
						they were going to a bed and breakfast for the weekend. His father gave him fifty dollars for the food he would need over the weekend and both of them were
						out the door within minutes.
					</p>
					<p>
						The next day, Mike text Jamie saying, "Hey, do you wanna come over to my house Sunday?" Jamie replied back with, "Hey! Sorry, I would, but I have a date
					with Ben tomorrow, maybe next time? :)" Mike was torn when he read the text; he could not believe Jamie was going to go out with Ben.	<em>Why is she going out with him? He's manipulating her. Making her believe that he's nice, he shouldn't do that, it's not right to lie to people. </em>
						After collecting his thoughts, he texted Jamie back saying, "Oh, okay. That's cool I guess&#8230;..yeah we'll just have to do it another time."
					</p>
					<p>
						On Monday, Mike went to school and Jamie again saw him enter. She went up to him with a sad face and said, "Mike, you'll never guess what happened. Ben
						stood me up yesterday; he didn't even call. God, how could I be so stupid, to think the most popular boy in school could like the new girl. The worst part
						is that he's not even here today, I guess I'm so ugly that he didn't even wanna see me at school." Mike put his hand on Jamie's shoulder in an attempt to
						console her and said, "Hey now, I'm sure that's not it. He doesn't know what he's losing out on. You're an incredible girl." "Thanks Mike, you're so
						sweet," she replied.
					</p>
					<p>
						A whole week passed and Mike and Jamie got close in that time with their lunchtime discussions as well as walks to their respective lockers. They did not
						pay attention to the other things going around in the school because they were having fun getting to know each other. However, that Monday at lunch, they
						would be given astonishing news. Someone came over to the table Mike and Jamie sat at. Jamie recognized the person as Ken, one of Ben's friends she had
						met. He asked her, "Hey, Jamie, um have you talked to Ben lately?" Jamie's face let out a look of anger mixed with sadness because she remembered that she
						had been stood up. She replied to Ken saying, "No. I haven't talked to him since last Friday when he asked me out and then stood me up on Sunday." "Well, I
						think there might be a reason for standing you up. Nobody has seen Ben for a week. He hasn't been in school and I called his mom and she said he's been
						missing. She hasn't talked to him or seen him either, I've been asking people but nobody knows anything," he exclaimed. Jamie's face turned from anger to
						disbelief. "No Way. Are you serious? What the hell is going on, I can't believe this, he can't just disappear he has to be somewhere. Are you serious? Do
						the police know, are they already looking for him or something," she cried. Ken replied saying, "Yeah, the police are on it right now, they're looking into
						where he was last or who he talked to, but they have no leads. Thanks for your help though, I'll keep you updated if I find anything out." Ken walked away
						and Jamie turned to Mike to further speak on the topic. "Can you believe that Mike? He's missing and here I was saying how mean he is for standing me up."
						"Yeah, it really is crazy, just to go missing. I never seen that before, crazy," he replied. Mike and Jamie continue eating their lunch and speak little
						more on the missing Ben subject until Mike switched the topic.
					</p>
					<p>
						For the next month, Mike tried getting close to Jamie. They started talking on the phone at night and would constantly text each other. Mike was feeling
						things he had never felt before and was starting to trust Jamie more and more, which was hard for him to do. He was trying to get the courage to ask her
						out on a date. He practiced in front of the mirror and looked up techniques on the Internet. He finally thought he had enough courage to ask her out so,
						one day when they were having their usual lunch conversations he said to her, "Hey Jamie, I have to ask you something." "Yeah, sure, what is it," she
						replied. Mike took a deep breath and said, "Listen, we've been really getting close this past month and I feel like I know you a lot now. We've been having
						a lot of fun at lunch so I was thinking maybe we could go on a date maybe?" Jamie, trying to hide the shocked look on her face replied in a low voice
						saying, "Geee, Mike. I don't know what to say. You're a really nice guy and all but, I don't think I'm ready to go out with someone yet. I'm still not over
						the whole Ben missing thing. He still hasn't been found and you've been great trying to get me past that but, I'm scared that if I agree to go out with
						someone again, they might disappear too. Sorry." Mike's face turned red and he felt like he was going to throw up. He gathered all his strength to reply to
						her and he said, "Oh, yeah. Sure, I understand, don't worry about. I wouldn't want you to feel like that, I totally understand." They continued to eat
						their lunch but it was not the same. There were awkward pauses and glances at each other reminding them of the conversation that had just happened. Lunch
						finished and they went to their next classes. When their last class finished, the one they were both in, they did not talk to each other after class this
						time; they just went on to their own lockers. Both of them were relieved it was Friday because they could go home and come back after the weekend and
						hopefully things would be back to normal.
					</p>
					<p>
						The next day, Mike walked to the store to get some groceries. While he was walking home, he looked inside the window of a restaurant and saw Jamie at a
						table sitting with Ken. Mike was surprised to see Jamie there after she had just told him she was still not over Ben's disappearance. He did not want to
						assume, so he watched the window carefully in order to not be seen. After a few minutes of watching the window, he saw Jamie lean in and give Ken a kiss.
						Mike could not believe what he had just seen; he was lied to after all he had done for Jamie. He was furious. So furious that he went straight home, went
						up to his room, opened his notebook, and under the crossed out name of Ben, he wrote "Jamie."
